2D arrays are the Matrix. in real world the 2d thing doesnot exist.Only exist the 1d but inside the 1d 1more matrix is present 
syso(arr)-> output main address
syso(Arr[1]) -> give the address of the elements at 1st row

how to access the main element -> arr[2][1];  //2nd row 1st column

//HOW TO DECLARE 2D ARRAY 
int[][] arr= new int[n][m];  //n * m size matrix , where n is row and m is column

in cpp -> vector<vector<int>> arr(n,vector<int>(m,0)); isko typedef krke shot synatx bhi kr skte hai

//HOW TO TAKE INPUT OF 2D ARRAYS IN JAVA
using 2 for loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // for rows
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) { // for columns loop
                arr[i][j] = scn.nextInt();
            }
        }
